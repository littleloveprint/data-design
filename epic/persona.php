			<h1>Persona</h1>

		<main>
			<p><strong>Name: </strong>Courtney Thompson<br><strong>Age: </strong>27</p>
			<p><strong>Profession: </strong>Part time Festival Server for Bosque Brewing Co., as well as full time nanny for a family with 6 children.</p>
			<p><strong>Technology: </strong>MacBook Pro at work and at home. She also has a Samsung Galaxy S7 with an unlimited 4G data plan.</p>
			<p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors: </strong>Courtney loves all things handmade and small/independent business. She is always on the look out for creative gifts and games for the kids she cares for. She is also in charge of sourcing unique items for festival displays. Seeing as her time is pretty maxed out, she prefers to shop and source online.</p>
			<p><strong>Frustrations and Needs: </strong>Courtney created an account on Etsy as that is where she has been able to shop for both of her jobs. Before purchasing anything for either job, she needs approval so she can be reimbursed. Since she isn't always able to get approval right away, she creates a bookmark for every item she is waiting on approval for. Courtney would like to be able to favorite items and come back to them later if they get approved. This way, she wouldn't need to constantly create and delete bookmarks.</p>
			<p><strong>Goals: </strong>Courtney's goal is to manage her time better. She plans to spend an hour at the beginning of each week favoriting items on Etsy and then sending links to her employers. She then plans on spending only a few minutes at the end of the week adding approved items from her favorites list to her shopping cart for purchase.</p>
